# Asset Management REST API

A Spring Boot based REST API for managing company assets such as laptops, keyboards, furniture, and other items.  
This application keeps track of asset categories, asset details, their condition, and assignment to employees.

## ‚öñ Business Rules

* Asset can be **Assigned** to exactly one employee.
* Asset can be **Recovered** (status changes to `Recovered`, `assignTo` set to `null`).
* Asset **cannot be deleted** if its status is `Assigned`.
* Categories must exist before creating an asset.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anoushka-10/asset-management.git
   ```

2. Build and run:

   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

3. Access API at:

   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

4. H2 Database Console (for debugging):

   ```
   http://localhost:8080/h2-console
   ```

## ‚úÖ Assignment Requirements Coverage

* [x] Add / Update / List Categories
* [x] Add / Update / List / Search Assets
* [x] Assign Asset to Employee
* [x] Recover Asset
* [x] Delete Asset with business rules
* [x] Employee pre-seeded in DB
* [x] H2 Database + Spring Boot + JPA

---

## üìñ Notes

* Used **DTOs** (`CategoryDTO`, `AssetDTO`, `EmployeeDTO`) for request/response mapping.
* Basic exception handling implemented (asset not found, deletion restriction, etc.).
* In production, `@ControllerAdvice` and custom exceptions would improve error handling.
